val today = SimpleDate(GregorianCalendar())
val location = Location(30.045411, 31.236735, 2.0, 0)
val azan = Azan(location, Method.EGYPT_SURVEY)
val prayerTimes = azan.getPrayerTimes(today)
val imsaak = azan.getImsaak(today) 
println("----------------results------------------------") 
println("date ---> " + today.day + " / " + today.month + " / " + today.year)
println("imsaak ---> $imsaak") println("Fajr ---> " + prayerTimes.fajr()) 
println("sunrise --->" + prayerTimes.shuruq())
println("Zuhr --->" + prayerTimes.thuhr())
println("Asr --->" + prayerTimes.assr()) 
println("Maghrib --->" + prayerTimes.maghrib())
println("ISHA  --->" + prayerTimes.ishaa())
println("----------------------------------------")
